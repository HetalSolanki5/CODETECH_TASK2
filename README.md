Overview Of the Project
A Grade Tracker Project is an application that allows users (students, teachers, or parents) to record, track, and analyze student grades over a period of time. This project can serve as a simple console-based tool or be expanded into a full-fledged web application, depending on the complexity desired. Below is an outline of what a basic Grade Tracker Project could involve, including key features and steps for development.
